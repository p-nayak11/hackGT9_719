# STING.

## Problem Statement ##

How many times have you forgotten your BuzzCard at your dorm? Forcing your BuzzCard into a phone sleeve? We seek to digitize BuzzCards without compromising student information and data security. `STING.` is a mobile application intended to provide convenience and accessibility for Georgia Tech students.

## Need ##

As technology continues to become integrated into our daily lives, we often find ourselves become more congizant and aware of the presence of these mobile technolgies. Companies and banks have realized the incentive of digitizing common identification and payments. Driver's License, employee ID's, and barcodes are all identification mediums that have been added to the digital landscape.
