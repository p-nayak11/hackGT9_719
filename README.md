# STING.

## Problem Statement ##

How many times have you forgotten your BuzzCard at your dorm? Forcing your BuzzCard into a phone sleeve? We seek to digitize BuzzCards without compromising student information and data security. `STING.` is a mobile application intended to provide convenience and accessibility for Georgia Tech students.

## Need ##

As technology continues to become integrated into our daily lives, we often find ourselves become more congizant and aware of the presence of these mobile technolgies. Companies and banks have realized the incentive of digitizing common identification and payments. Driver's License, employee ID's, and barcodes are all identification mediums that have been added to the digital landscape.  


## Process ##
We built the project using the Unity Engine. Through the use of Plastic SCM, cloud storage was reached, so we could share our changes in real-time as we all tackled different aspects of the project. We implemented all of our code in C# where a sample database of GT students and their data was created to test out our project. Ultimately we focused our project to work on Apple devices due to the functionalities of Apple Wallet.



## Challenges ##
We faced several technical and general challenges throughout the process of Sting's development. A main theme of an issue that we kept running into was the problem of money. We kept encountering paywalls when it came to developing freely with xcode and swift, or allowing all of our group members to work collaboratively on unity because of a 3 person restriction on the free version. Despite, the challenges we persevered past them, being innovative and creative when it came to efficiently spending our time towards our goal. We also came into several stumps, and in those time we reached out for help, watch many, many videos, and took a rest when we needed it.  We learned that sometimes a fresh perspective aided in simplfying complex problems. Overall, the hackathon taught us a lot through these hardships.



## Future Outlook ## 
As we look towards the future, we know there are many ways to enhance our application. A massive concern with any digital form of transaction has always been security, and with Sting we plan to implement history logs within the app to keep track of transactions/ general card authorizations, we also plan to implmenet facial detection software to enhance security when logging in. Of course like many other universities, Georgia Tech being the next, we plan to expand our program to other universities.
